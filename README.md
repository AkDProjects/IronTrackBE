# Iron-Track Back End

Iron-Track Back End is the service layer between Iron-Track and Iron-Track's database. This repo is intended to be used concurrently with the client-side repo for Iron Track which can be found [here](https://github.com/canasmh/iron-track).
## Installation

To Develop: Install JDK, run
```
 mvn install
```
in terminal. This will install the dependencies from the Maven Pom file.

To Run: Install JRE, go to command line, type
```
JavacIronTrackBE.java
```
this will compile the java program, then

 ```
java IronTrackBe
```
will run the program.

## Environment Variables
There are two environment variables that are required in order for dependencies to be installed correctly. These two variables are the API key (`API_KEY`) that is used to connect to the [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/), and the secret key (`SECRET_KEY`) used to generate JWT's.

Regardless of whether you choose to define these environments in the configurations of your IDE, or if you want to define them in the application properties, you will need to have a local copy of application properties.

```
cp src/main/resources/application.properties.sample src/main/resources/application.properties
```

You will need to create an account with API Ninjas in order to receive a valid API key, but the secret key can be randomly generated by running the following command in the command line:

```
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

and then set the value of `SECRET_KEY` to be the output of the above command.

## Database
We use a potsgreSQL database that runs on `localhost:5432`. Of course the host, port, and database name can be configured in the `application.properties`, but be sure to have a database running and pointing to the location prescribed in `application.properties`.
